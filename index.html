                <p><strong>S</strong>cientists have worked out when our Sun will die. It won't be any time soon. It will be in 10 billion years. The scientists are from the University of Manchester in the UK. They predict that in about 5 billion years from now, the Sun will turn into a "red giant". This is the scientific name given to a star at the end of its life. When our Sun becomes a red giant, its centre will shrink. Its outer layers will expand as far as Mars. This means Earth will be burnt and disappear. After our Sun turns into a red giant, it will become a planetary nebula. This is a bubble of gas and space dust. The scientists say no humans will be on Earth when the Sun dies out. Humans will disappear in around one billion years from now.</p>

                <p><strong>E</strong>gypt is a land of eternal mystery and wonder. It is a paradise for archaeologists hoping to unearth the latest ancient marvel. Archaeologists at an extensive excavation near the northern Egyptian city of Alexandria have just made such a discovery. Kathleen Martinez, an archaeologist at the University of Santo Domingo, has dedicated most of her life to searching for the long-lost tomb of Queen Cleopatra. The queen ruled over Egypt more than 1,000 years ago. Earlier this week, Martinez and her team stumbled upon an amazing find. They uncovered a 1,305-metre tunnel, located 13 metres underground. Architectural design experts have called it an "engineering miracle".</p>

                <p><strong>W</strong>e all know about the damage being done to the environment by industries, households, belching cows and the release of methane from permafrost. A new report highlights a source of CO2 emissions that few of us are aware of – billionaires. The British charity Oxfam has reported that the lavish lifestyles of the world's wealthiest create significantly more CO2 than the average person. It conducted an analysis of the investments and lifestyles of 125 of the world's richest billionaires. The conclusion was that the average billionaire is responsible for 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. This is a million times more than the average person creates. Collectively, billionaires create as much CO2 as France.</p>

                <p><strong>W</strong>ith the spiralling cost of living, many people are making drastic cutbacks. In the UK, millions of people can no longer afford essential hygiene products. This has been termed "hygiene poverty". A report from the charity Hygiene Bank states that up to 3.2 million adults are affected by this. Britons are foregoing basic goods such as soap, deodorant, toothpaste, shaving products, toilet paper and sanitary products. They are facing the harrowing decision of eating and heating their homes and not buying hygiene products. Hygiene Bank described the problem as a "hidden crisis". It said the situation is "much more widespread than we feared. It's increasing, and it's disproportionately impacting the most vulnerable".</p>

                <p><strong>P</strong>arts of her cultural inheritance are scattered across the Tanami desert in northwestern Australia, where dozens of ancient boab trees are engraved with Aboriginal designs. These tree carvings — called dendroglyphs — could be hundreds or even thousands of years old, yet have received almost no attention from western researchers.</p>
                <p>For Garstone, the expedition was a bid to piece back together the disparate parts of her identity. These pieces were scattered 70 years ago when Garstone's mother and three siblings were among the estimated 100,000 Aboriginal children taken from their families by the Australian government. Like many others, the siblings were sent to live at a Christian mission thousands of kilometers from home. It would take decades of effort and a series of unconnected events — including the gift of an heirloom and a researcher's quest to find out what happened to a missing 19th century European naturalist — for Garstone's family to reclaim its birthright.</p>
